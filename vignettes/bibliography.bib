Proteins are essential agents of biological processes. To date, large-scale profiling of cell line collections including the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) has focused primarily on genetic information whereas deep interrogation of the proteome has remained out of reach. Here, we expand the CCLE through quantitative profiling of thousands of proteins by mass spectrometry across 375 cell lines from diverse lineages to reveal information undiscovered by DNA and RNA methods. We observe unexpected correlations within and between pathways that are largely absent from RNA. An analysis of microsatellite instable (MSI) cell lines reveals the dysregulation of specific protein complexes associated with surveillance of mutation and translation. These and other protein complexes were associated with sensitivity to knockdown of several different genes. These data in conjunction with the wider CCLE are a broad resource to explore cellular behavior and facilitate cancer research."

	abstract = {We recently reported the quantitative proteomics of 375 samples as part of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (Nusinow et al., 2020). Mass spectrometry-based proteomics data is broadly unfamiliar to most biologists in our experience, resulting in questions from analysts about how to use the data. From the proteomics community there was interest about how we normalized the data, as the scope of this project was so much larger than what has been commonly available. This paper serves as a guide to the data set to answer these questions and acts as a supplement to the main manuscript. The first part addresses users of the data, describing the experimental design, interpretation of the values, and dealing with standard issues in proteomics like multiple protein isoforms per gene and missing values. The second part of the manuscript details how we arrived at the normalization procedure reported in the paper, including the diagnostics used to assess multiple normalization schemes.},
